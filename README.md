## What is KMP?
Kotlin Multiplatform is a Kotlin-based framework that allows code sharing and frameworks between different platforms.
- JetBrains developed Kotlin Multiplatform, and using it to target mobile platforms is stable and production-ready

## Environment setup.
- [Please follow this link to complete this step.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-setup.html)
-  If you are running on Mac you can verify your environment requirements are successfully set by running
```shell
$ kdoctor
```
- Your response should be as follows. In case you run into an issue with `Cocoapods` for the Apple Silicon Chip [please check this resource and follow the steps](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64901180/how-to-run-cocoapods-on-apple-silicon-m1/66556339#66556339).

## Project structure
Each Kotlin Multiplatform project includes three modules:
- **shared** is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications â€“ the code you share between platforms. It uses Gradle as the build system to help automate your build process.
- **androidApp** is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.
- **iosApp** is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as an iOS framework. The shared module can be used as a regular framework or as a CocoaPods dependency, based on what you've chosen for iOS framework distribution. For now, we focus on regular framework dependency.

- The shared module consists of three source sets: `androidMain`, `commonMain`, and `iosMain`. Source set is a Gradle concept for a number of files logically grouped together where each group has its own dependencies. In Kotlin Multiplatform, different source sets in a shared module can target different platforms

- The common source set uses common Kotlin code, and platform source sets use Kotlin code specific to each target. Kotlin/JVM is used for `androidMain` and Kotlin/Native for `iosMain`:

- When the shared module is built into an Android library, common Kotlin code is treated as Kotlin/JVM. When it is built into an iOS framework, common Kotlin is treated as Kotlin/Native

## Understanding Platform - `expect` and `actual`.
Take a look at from `commonMain`:
```Kotlin
interface Platform {
    val name: String
}

expect fun getPlatform(): Platform
```
- The `expect` instructs the Kotlin compiler that the implementation must exist in both `androidMain` and `iosMain` folders. `Platform` is similar to an abstract class in kt.
- The `actual` instructs the Kotlin compiler the actual platform-based code to return. In this case, the features from each platform are independent of their respective platform.

Android:
```Kotlin
class AndroidPlatform : Platform {
    override val name: String = "Android ${android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT}"
}

actual fun getPlatform(): Platform = AndroidPlatform()
```
iOS:
```Kotlin
import platform.UIKit.UIDevice

class IOSPlatform: Platform {
    override val name: String = UIDevice.currentDevice.systemName() + " " + UIDevice.currentDevice.systemVersion
}

actual fun getPlatform(): Platform = IOSPlatform()
```
